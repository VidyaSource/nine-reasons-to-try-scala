#Vidya Tutorial: Nine Reasons to Try Scala

##Description

These are the files that accompany the [Vidya](http://www.vidyasource.com) video tutorial 
[Nine Reasons to Try Scala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqQDL3imBy4) on features of the Scala language and ecosystem
that make it a compelling choice for developers.


##Intended Audience

This tutorial is for intermediate-level Java developers, and developers in other languages too, who are curious about 
what the big deal is with the Scala programming language.


##Instructions

Just download the files and view them in your favorite editor. Follow along with the tutorial [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq0ArQhhWzU),
or play with the code yourself to try different ideas.

The code is in the form of Scala worksheets, which you can run in both [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr1a) with the appropriate Scala plugins. 
Both are free.

Or if you prefer, you can [install Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) and copy and paste the code into
the [shell](http://scala-lang.org/documentation/getting-started.html?_ga=1.151579321.1007941740.1427391086#your_first_lines_of_code).
